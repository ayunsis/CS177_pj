\abstract{
This study systematically evaluates the reliability of AlphaFold3 (AF3)-predicted protein structures for protein-ligand affinity (PLA) prediction tasks. The Sfcnn model, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for PLA prediction, was reproduced using PyTorch. Model performance was validated on the PDBbind v2019 refined set for training and the CASF-2016 core set for testing. Subsequently, AF3-derived protein structures from the CASF-2016 core set were assessed and compared to experimentally determined structures using Sfcnn scores to determine the suitability of AF3 predictions in PLA applications.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsection{Background}
AlphaFold3 (AF3), DeepMind's latest AlphaFold model, predicts protein and protein–ligand structures with high accuracy. It extends AlphaFold2 by adding explicit ligand modeling, enhanced multimer assembly support, and optimized multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) via deep neural networks trained on extensive sequence and structural data~\cite{AF3}.

Sfcnn is a 3D convolutional neural network-based scoring function introduced by Wang et al.~\cite{Sfcnn} in 2022, designed to provide accurate and reliable predictions of binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes.
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsection{Objective}
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of AlphaFold3-predicted protein-ligand complex structures for protein-ligand affinity (PLA) prediction. Using the Chai-1 server for AF3 structure generation, we ensure support for custom ligands and robust MSA construction. The resulting AF3 structures are assessed with the reproduced Sfcnn model, and predicted affinities are compared to those from experimentally determined structures. This enables a direct evaluation of AF3's suitability for PLA prediction and highlights its current strengths and limitations.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsection{Datasets}
The Sfcnn network was trained using protein-ligand complexes from the PDBbind v2019 refined set\cite{Wang2005PDBbind}, which includes experimentally determined binding affinities (pKa values). The model was evaluated on the CASF-2016~\cite{su2018comparative} core set, comprising 285 protein-ligand complexes. To prevent data leakage, 266 overlapping protein complexes between the training and test sets were excluded, resulting in 4,852 unique training complexes.

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
To increase the effective size of the training set, each protein-ligand complex was randomly rotated nine times using random rotation matrices, yielding ten variants per complex. All variants share the same PLA score, resulting in a total of 48,520 training samples.

\subsection{Featurization}
Protein-ligand complexes are represented as 3D grids of size $20 \times 20 \times 20$, with each grid cell encoded as a one-hot vector of length 28. This vector comprises 14 protein atom types\footnote{\url{https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04762-3}} and 14 ligand atom types. The resulting training tensor has shape $(48520, 20, 20, 20, 28)$.

    \label{fig:onehot}
\end{figure}

\section{Sfcnn Network Architecture and Implementation}

\subsection{Architecture}
The original Sfcnn publication describes four network architectures and three featurization strategies. The architecture depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:CNN}, combined with the aforementioned featurization, achieved optimal validation performance.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/CNN.png}
    \caption{Final CNN architecture for the Sfcnn network.}
    \label{fig:CNN}
\end{figure}

This architecture employs 3D convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation. L2 regularization is applied to the output layer to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The PyTorch implementation closely mirrors the original TensorFlow version, with two key differences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Due to PyTorch's \texttt{Conv3D} API, input tensors are permuted to shape (batch\_size, 28, 20, 20, 20).
    \item PyTorch lacks a direct L2 regularization API; instead, weight decay is applied to the final fully connected layer to approximate this effect.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Storage}
The original Sfcnn implementation stored data as concatenated arrays in a single \texttt{.pkl} (pickle) file, requiring all data to reside in memory, which is impractical for extremely large datasets. The HDF5 format (\texttt{.h5}) via \texttt{h5py} was adopted for incremental writing and efficient storage. The resulting training grid occupies 40.1 GiB.

\subsection{Training Procedure}
Training and validation sets are partitioned as in the original study, with the validation set comprising indices 41,000 to 48,520. The resulting splits are: training $(41,000, 20,20,20,28)$, validation $(7,520, 20,20,20,28)$, and test $(285, 20,20,20,28)$, corresponding to a ratio of 84.00\% : 15.42\% : 0.58\%. 

Note that the original hyperparameters did not yield convergence in our PyTorch experiments. Both sets of hyperparameters are summarized below.

Epochs & 200 & 400 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Reproduced Results}
\label{sec:ReproducedResults}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Sfcnn performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{RMSE} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_{\text{predict}} - y_{\text{true}})^2} \\
\mathrm{MAE} &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |y_{\text{predict}} - y_{\text{true}}| \\
\mathrm{SD} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} ((a y_{\text{predict}} + b) - y_{\text{true}})^2} \\
\mathrm{R} &= \frac{\mathbb{E}[(y_{\text{predict}} - \mu_{y_{\text{predict}}})(y_{\text{true}} - \mu_{y_{\text{true}}})]}{\sigma_{y_{\text{predict}}} \sigma_{y_{\text{true}}}}
\end{align*}

where $a$ and $b$ are the slope and intercept of the linear regression between predicted and measured values, $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ denotes expectation, and $\mu$ and $\sigma$ represent means and standard deviations, respectively.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Performance Metrics on CASF-2016 Core Set}
\label{tab:metrics}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Metric & Reproduced Sfcnn & Original Sfcnn \\
\midrule
Pearson R & 0.7678 & 0.7928 \\
RMSE & 1.4647 & 1.3263 \\
MAE & 1.1633 & 1.0277 \\
SD & 1.3928 & 1.3252 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
        \centering

        \caption{Training curve for original hyperparameters.}
        \label{fig:OriginalPlot}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Although the original Sfcnn reports superior metrics, its training process did not converge during reproduction, raising concerns regarding the reproducibility of the reported performance. 
Due to the lack of access to the original training data and the absence of author responses to data requests on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bioinfocqupt/Sfcnn/issues/1}}, the original training process is deemed irreproducible.

The training, validation, and testing results for the four metrics are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ReproducedPlot} and Figure~\ref{fig:OriginalPlot}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/origin_param.png}
    \caption{Training curve for original hyperparameters.}
    \label{fig:OriginaltrainPlot}
\end{figure}
The residuals of the test set (gaps between predicted and true values) are visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:test residuals}. 
The histogram approximately follows a normal distribution, 
indicating that the model's predictions are generally unbiased, with most errors concentrated around zero.

\end{figure}


We conjectured that the divergent results are caused by unusually high learning rate and dropout rate;
therefore, the reproduced results are considered the baseline for subsequent AF3 result assessment.

\section{AlphaFold3 Result Assessment}

\subsection{Dataset Selection}
The assessment utilizes the CASF-2016 core set, excluding six proteins with structural complexity beyond AlphaFold3's predictive capacity, resulting in 279 proteins. Proteins with more than five isomorphic or heterogeneous chains were excluded, as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:complex}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Excluded Complex Protein Structures}
\label{tab:complex}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
PDB ID & Number of Chains \\
\midrule
2xb8 & 12 \\
2ymd & 10 \\
3n76 & 12 \\
3n7a & 12 \\
3n86 & 12 \\
4ciw & 12 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Structure Generation and Processing}
Protein structures were generated using the \textit{Chai-1 online server}\footnote{\url{https://lab.chaidiscovery.com/dashboard}}. The AlphaFold3 online server\footnote{\url{https://alphafoldserver.com/}} was not used due to its inability to accept specific ligand SMILES codes. The MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) option was enabled with the MMseqs2 algorithm for all generations.

Server outputs were downloaded as zip archives containing multiple ranked structures and associated metrics. The top-ranked structure (\texttt{pred.rank\_0.cif}) was selected for analysis. To avoid conversion errors between file formats (.cif, .pdb, .mol2), structures were parsed directly using the \texttt{MMCIFParser} from the \texttt{Bio.PDB} Python package, followed by featurization and grid mapping.

Atoms or isotopes not included in the 14 predefined atom types are categorized as \texttt{other}.

\subsection{Scoring Protocol}
To quantitatively assess the reliability of AlphaFold3 (AF3)-predicted structures 
for protein-ligand affinity (PLA) prediction, we evaluated the predicted complexes 
using the reproduced Sfcnn network, initialized with pre-trained weights 
(Pearson $R = 0.768$). The experimentally determined PLA values from the PDBbind 
v2019 core set served as the ground truth. 
For benchmarking, the predicted scores for AF3-generated structures are compared 
against both the ground truth and the Sfcnn scores obtained from experimentally 
resolved structures, employing the same evaluation metrics as 
in Section~\ref{sec:ReproducedResults}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Performance metrics for Sfcnn AF3-predicted structures compared to Sfcnn CASF2016 and groundtruth.}
\label{tab:af3_metrics}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Metric & vs. CASF2016 Sfcnn & vs. Groundtruth \\
\midrule
Pearson $R$ & 0.2930 & 0.3850 \\
RMSE        & 2.0836 & 1.1669 \\
MAE         & 1.6933 & 0.9231 \\
SD          & 2.0825 & 1.0970 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As summarized in Table~\ref{tab:af3_metrics}, 
the correlation between predicted and experimental 
affinities decreases when using AF3-generated structures
 (Pearson $R = 0.2930$) compared to experimentally 
 determined structures (Pearson $R = 0.3850$). 
 Both RMSE and MAE are notably higher for AF3 predictions, 
 indicating increased prediction error and reduced model 
 reliability on these structures.

\subsection{Residual Analysis and Visualization}
To further dissect the sources and distribution of prediction errors, 
a series of visual analyses are presented below:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/top20_heatmap.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/gap_histogram.png}
    \caption{Heatmap (top) of the top 20 complexes with the largest prediction gaps and histogram (bottom) of absolute prediction gaps for AF3 structures.}
    \label{fig:af3_heatmap_hist}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:af3_heatmap_hist} illustrate the distribution and magnitude of prediction errors. The heatmap highlights complexes with the largest discrepancies between AF3-predicted and ground truth PLA scores, while the histogram reveals a right-skewed error profile, indicating that a substantial fraction of complexes exhibit large deviations.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/gap_violinplot.png}
    \caption{violin plot of prediction gaps for AF3 structures.}
    \label{fig:af3_gap_violin}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:af3_gap_violin} provides a complementary perspective: 
the violin plot visualizes the full error distribution, 
emphasizing the significantly higher presence of large gaps.

\subsection{Interpretation and Implications}
Collectively, these results demonstrate that while the reproduced Sfcnn model 
maintains moderate agreement with experimental affinities on the CASF-2016 core set, 
its predictive performance deteriorates when applied to AF3-predicted structures. 
The observed increase in RMSE and MAE, coupled with reduced correlation, 
indicates that current AF3 structural models introduce additional uncertainty into affinity 
prediction pipelines.

The top 10 error complexes and their corresponding protein structures and Chai-1 overall confidence scores
are demonstrated in Table~\ref{tab:top10_error}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Top 10 complexes with the largest prediction gaps.
`heter' denotes heterogeneous, `iso' denotes isomorphic.}
\label{tab:top10_error}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
PDB ID & Aggregate Score & Prediction Gap & chain structure\\
\midrule
5c2h & 0.95 & 4.23 & 1 chain\\
2x00 & 0.93 & 4.01 & 5 heter\\
4f3c & 0.97 & 3.85 & 2 iso\\
5dwr & 0.90 & 3.44 & 1 chain\\
4u4s & 0.89 & 3.31 & 2 heter\\
1mq6 & 0.97 & 3.15 & 2 heter\\
\textbf{4tmn} & \textbf{0.63} & \textbf{3.10} & \textbf{2 iso}\\
4gid & 0.96 & 3.06 & 1 chain\\
3l7b & 0.93 & 3.05 & 2 iso\\
3utu & 0.97 & 3.00 & 2 heter\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Statistics of these complexes show no significant correlation with protein structures,
suggesting that AF3's performance degradation is \textbf{not} attributable to the incapability of 
handling certain particular complex structures. However, the
overall high aggregate scores raise concerns about the reliability of
AF3's confidence scores in the context of PLA prediction. 

\subsection{Hypotheses for AF3's Reduced Performance}
The observed decrease in PLA prediction accuracy for 
AF3-generated structures may be attributed to AF3's methodological limitations and
constraints in the training dataset. The following hypotheses are proposed with
reference to the work of Zheng et al.~\cite{Zheng2025.04.07.647682}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Diffusion Module Limitations:} 
    
    AF3's diffusion-based architecture lacks explicit 
    physics-based energy calculations essential for accurate binding affinity prediction. 
    While it generates structurally plausible conformations, 
    the absence of energy functions prevents reliable ranking 
    of binding interactions. Additionally, 
    the model may inadequately represent conformational 
    ensembles due to its reliance on static crystallographic 
    structures during training.

    \item \textbf{AF3 Dataset Constraints:} 
     
    The training dataset exhibits temporal limitations 
    (pre-cutoff structures only) and conformational 
    bias toward static X-ray structures, 
    limiting the representation of dynamic binding processes. 
    The underrepresentation of binding affinity data and 
    potential memorization of training structures rather 
    than learning generalizable physical principles may 
    contribute to reduced performance on novel 
    protein-ligand pairs.

\end{enumerate}

These hypotheses suggest that both target-specific structural challenges and broader methodological 
limitations of AF3 contribute to the observed performance gap. Future work could involve targeted analysis of outlier complexes and the development of structure prediction models specifically tailored for affinity prediction tasks.

\section{Conclusion}
This study presents a systematic evaluation of AlphaFold3-predicted protein structures 
for protein-ligand affinity prediction using a reproduced Sfcnn model. 
The findings highlight the importance of reproducibility in deep learning models for 
structural biology and demonstrate the current capabilities and limitations of AF3 in 
the context of PLA prediction.
