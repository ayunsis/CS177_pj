	abstract = {Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions remains a cornerstone challenge in drug discovery. AlphaFold3 (AF3), a recent breakthrough Diffusion Transformer model, holds significant promise for structural biology, but its performance across diverse pharmaceutical applications requires systematic evaluation. In this study, we comprehensively benchmark AF3{\textquoteright}s capabilities using carefully curated datasets, examining its performance in binary protein-ligand complexes, apo/holo structural variations, GPCR-ligand conformations, ternary systems, and inhibitor affinity prediction.Our analysis reveals that AF3 excels at predicting static protein-ligand interactions with minimal conformational changes, significantly outperforming traditional docking methods in side-chain orientation accuracy. However, we identify critical limitations: AF3 struggles with protein-ligand complexes involving significant conformational changes (\&gt;5{\r A} RMSD), demonstrates a persistent bias toward active GPCR conformations regardless of ligand type, performs poorly on ternary complex prediction, and lacks reliable affinity ranking capability. Notably, AF3{\textquoteright}s performance declined significantly on structures released after its training cutoff date, suggesting potential memorization rather than physical understanding of molecular interactions.We explored AF3{\textquoteright}s practical utility through applications in chemoproteomics data interpretation, drug resistance mutation prediction, and kinome profiling simulation. AF3 demonstrated value as a {\textquotedblleft}true-hit binary interaction modeler,{\textquotedblright} capable of generating reliable structural models for experimentally validated binding pairs. However, its ranking metrics showed minimal correlation with experimental binding affinities and limited ability to differentiate across the kinome, highlighting the need for integration with physics-based scoring methods.Our findings indicate that while AF3 represents a significant advancement in protein-ligand structure prediction, it requires complementary approaches to address its limitations in conformational sampling, affinity ranking, and complex system modeling. Recent developments like YDS Ternoplex suggest that enhanced sampling techniques can overcome some of these limitations. The optimal strategy for leveraging AF3 in drug discovery likely involves its integration into hybrid computational pipelines that combine AI-based prediction with physics-based refinement and experimental validation.Competing Interest StatementJ.W. is the co-founder of Chemical Biology Probes LLC.
